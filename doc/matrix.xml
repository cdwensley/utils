   <Oper Name="DirectSumDecompositionMatrices"
         Arg="M" />
<Description>
In June 2023 Hongyi Zhao asked in the Forum for a function to implement 
matrix decomposition into blocks. 
Such a function was then provided by Pedro García-Sánchez. 
Hongyi Zhao then requested that the function be added to 
<Package>Utils</Package>. 
What is provided here is a revised version of the original solution, 
returning a list of decompositions. 
<P/> 
This function is a partial inverse to the undocumented library operation 
<C>DirectSumMat</C>.  
So if <M>L</M> is the list of diagonal decompositions of a matrix <M>M</M> 
then each entry in <M>L</M> is a list of matrices, and the direct sum of 
each of these lists is equal to the original <M>M</M>. 
<P/> 
In the examples, <M>M_6</M> is an obvious direct sum with <M>3</M> blocks. 
<M>M_4</M> is an example with three decompositions, 
while <M>M_8 = M_4 \oplus M_4</M> has <M>16</M> decompositions (not listed).
